            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To you therefore I recommend the conſideration of theſe Diſorders, as beſt becoming your Prudence to apply the proper Remedies, and you may be ſure of my hearty Concurrence in every thing that will conduce to the extinguiſhing thoſe Heats and Annimoſities among you, which I fear have been of late years induſtriouſly cheriſh't and fomented, and to the the curing all the other Diſorders and Miſchiefs among you.</p>
                     <p>It hath been repreſented to the Government in <hi>England.</hi> That this Province hath been a noted Receptacle of Pyrates, and the Trade of it under no Reſtriction, but the Acts of Trade violated, by the Neglect and Connivance of thoſe whoſe Duty it was to have prevented it. I hope <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you will put all the Diſcountenance imaginable on that flagacious Crime of <hi>Pyracy,</hi> which is not only the worſt fort of Robbery, but is, for the moſt part attended with the horrid Sin of Murder, which is a great aggravation of that odious Practice, deteſted by all the Civil Nations of the World. 'Tis not only injurious to the Honour of his Majeſty, and the Engliſh Nation, but alſo highly prejudicial to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company. And the Gentlemen of the Council here preſent will bear me witneſs, that my Orders from his Majeſty are very ſtrict for enquiring into, and effectually preventing for the future that Lawleſs and Vile Trade of Pyracy within all my Covernment.</p>
                     <p>As I have declared my ſelf againſt Pyracy, and all Unlawful Trade, ſo I muſt aſſure you I will give you all the Encouragement I can poſſibly in carrying on a lawful Trade, and every thing elſe that will make you Happy and Flouriſhing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker and you Gentlemen Repreſentatives;</hi>
                        <lb/>
I Hope you will take into your Conſideration, That the Revenue is near expiring, and that you will provide for the Support of the Government for the time to come; and therein give me leave to put you in mind, that your Duty and Reſpect to his Majeſty ſhould be an agrument to you, not to leave the Government deſtitute. It would be hard, if I that come among you with an honeſt mind, and a Reſolution to be juſt to your Intereſt, ſhould meet with greater Difficulties in the diſcharge of his Majeſties Service than thoſe that have gone before me. I will take care there ſhall be no Miſ-application of the Publick Money: I will Pocket none of it my ſelf, nor ſhall there be any Imbezilment by others, but exact Accounts ſhall be given you, when and as often as you ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>I have ordered all the Accounts to be laid before you, that you may ſee the ſtate of the Debts of the Government, and take ſuch courſe for the Diſcharge of them as you ſhall think fit. I wiſh too you would conſider how to reſtore Credit to the Government, which I underſtand is now very low, if not wholly loſt.</p>
                     <p>I have ordered the Engineer to go and viſit the Fronteers, and to report to me the State and Condition he finds the Fortifications in, which Report I intend for you, as ſoon as it comes to my hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I muſt remind you of the Neceſſity there is of finding out ſome Expedient to reconcile the Parties among you. I muſt own to you, I ſet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37031:3"/>my heart ſo much on it, that I ſhall think it the Glory of my Government to bring ſo good a work to paſs I deſire therefore you will think of the proper Methods to effect an entire Reconciliation among you. To be of one Faith and one Mind is not only an excellent Scripture Rule, but alſo a good Maxim in Government. Union amongſt a People is the Bound of Peace, and of ſtrength too.</p>
                     <p>You cannot but know what Abuſes have been formerly in Elections of Members to ſerve in the Aſſembly, which tends much to the Subverſion of your Liberties. I do therefore recommend to you the making a Law to provide againſt it, and that you will think of ſuch other Laws as you will ſtand in need of to ſecure to this Province a laſting Happineſs, to which I promiſe you my Concurrence.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> with recommending that which is chiefly incumbent on us all, an inviolable Duty and Allegiance to his Majeſty, who by his valour has reſcued us from the two greateſt Plauges that ever infeſted the World, <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and by that, and his Wiſe and Temperate Government has ſecu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
